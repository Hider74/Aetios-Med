## Question Generation Guidelines

### Difficulty Levels

**Easy (Recall and Recognition)**
- Definition questions
- Basic fact recall
- Simple classifications
- Straightforward identification
- Example: "Which of the following is a beta-blocker?"

**Medium (Application and Analysis)**
- Clinical scenario application
- Mechanism questions
- Comparison and contrast
- Interpretation of data
- Example: "A patient presents with chest pain. Given their history, which investigation would you order first?"

**Hard (Synthesis and Evaluation)**
- Complex clinical cases
- Multi-step reasoning
- Differential diagnosis
- Treatment planning with complications
- Example: "A 67-year-old with multiple comorbidities presents with... What is your management plan and why?"

### Question Quality Standards

1. **Clinical Relevance**: Questions should relate to real clinical scenarios
2. **UK Context**: Use NHS protocols, NICE guidelines, BNF references
3. **Clear Stems**: Question should be unambiguous and complete
4. **Plausible Distractors**: Wrong answers should be tempting but distinctly incorrect
5. **Single Best Answer**: One option should be clearly correct
6. **Educational Value**: Explanation should teach, not just confirm

### Question Structure

Each question must include:
- **Question Stem**: Clear, complete clinical scenario or question
- **Options**: 4-5 answer choices labeled A, B, C, D, (E)
- **Correct Answer**: The letter of the correct option
- **Explanation**: Why the answer is correct and why others are wrong
- **Learning Points**: 2-3 key takeaways
- **References**: UK guidelines (NICE/BNF/GMC) when applicable

### UK Medical Focus Areas

Include questions on:
- **Clinical Medicine**: Diagnosis, investigations, management
- **Pharmacology**: BNF-based prescribing, interactions, contraindications
- **Anatomy & Physiology**: Applied clinical anatomy
- **Pathology**: Disease mechanisms and manifestations
- **Clinical Skills**: Communication, ethics, professionalism (GMC Outcomes)
- **Public Health**: NHS structure, screening, prevention

### Question Types to Include

1. **Single Best Answer (SBA)**: Most common format
2. **Clinical Vignettes**: Patient scenarios requiring diagnosis/management
3. **Data Interpretation**: Lab results, imaging, charts
4. **Mechanism Questions**: Physiological/pharmacological processes
5. **Ethics/Law**: GMC guidance, consent, capacity

### Adaptive Difficulty

- If confidence < 0.3: Focus on foundational concepts (60% easy, 30% medium, 10% hard)
- If confidence 0.3-0.7: Balanced mix (20% easy, 60% medium, 20% hard)
- If confidence > 0.7: Challenge them (10% easy, 30% medium, 60% hard)

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- ❌ Ambiguous questions with multiple defensible answers
- ❌ "All of the above" or "None of the above" options
- ❌ Trick questions that test memorization of obscure facts
- ❌ Questions with obvious correct answers
- ❌ US-specific content (use UK terminology and guidelines)
- ❌ Explanations that just restate the answer without teaching

### Example High-Quality Question

**Question:**
A 45-year-old woman presents to A&E with sudden onset severe headache described as "the worst headache of her life." She has neck stiffness and photophobia. Her observations show BP 165/95 mmHg, HR 88 bpm, temperature 37.2°C. She is alert and orientated. What is the most appropriate initial investigation?

A. CT head without contrast
B. Lumbar puncture
C. MRI brain with contrast
D. Cerebral angiography
E. No investigation needed - prescribe analgesia

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
This presentation is highly suggestive of subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). The key features are:
- Sudden onset "thunderclap" headache
- Neck stiffness (meningism)
- Photophobia

According to NICE guidelines, CT head without contrast is the first-line investigation for suspected SAH and should be performed within 1 hour. It has >95% sensitivity if performed within 6 hours of symptom onset.

Why other options are incorrect:
- B (LP): Only performed if CT is negative but suspicion remains high (12 hours post-headache for xanthochromia)
- C (MRI): Not first-line; takes too long in acute setting
- D (Angiography): Only after diagnosis confirmed to identify source
- E: Dangerous - missing SAH has high morbidity/mortality

**Learning Points:**
1. "Worst headache of life" + meningism = SAH until proven otherwise
2. CT head is first-line investigation (do within 1 hour per NICE)
3. If CT negative >6 hours post-onset, LP is needed to check for xanthochromia

**References:**
- NICE CG56: Head injury assessment and early management
- NICE CKS: Subarachnoid haemorrhage
